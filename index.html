            Ph.D. Candidate in Economics · IIT Guwahati
        </p>

        <p>
            I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at IIT Guwahati under the supervision of 
            Dr. Amarjyoti Mahanta. My research examines the labor market implications of 
            technological change, focusing on its impact on employment composition and 
            wage share in India’s organized and unorganized manufacturing sectors.
        </p>

        <p>
            My broader research interests include applied industrial organization and 
            labor economics, particularly structural transformation and labor market 
            dynamics in developing economies.
        </p>

        <p>
            I hold an M.Phil. and M.A. in Economics from Dibrugarh University, Assam 
            (CGPA: 8.61).

            <h3>Technological Change and Organized Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>
                Examining the impact of technological change on employment and wage share 
                in the Indian organized manufacturing sector. The analysis distinguishes 
                between production and managerial workers, with further disaggregation of 
                production workers into permanent and contractual categories.

        <div class="card">
            <h3>Technological Change and Unorganized Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>
                Investigating how technological change affects employment structure and 
                wage share in the Indian unorganized manufacturing sector, with a focus 
                on hired workers and unpaid family workers.

            <h3>Inter-Sectoral Spillovers</h3>
            <p>
                Analyzing whether technological change in the organized manufacturing 
                sector influences employment dynamics and expansion in the unorganized 
                sector, highlighting structural linkages between the two segments.
